A simple Web-Based To-Do App, where the user can enter todo to make a todo list and display it in the web screen. 

The To-Do List is not connected to any database; so as soon as we reload the page we will lose the todo list.

Their are respective buttons to add To-Do to the list and delete To-Do from the List.
